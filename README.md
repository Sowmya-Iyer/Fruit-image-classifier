# Fruit-image-classifier
Building a CNN from scratch

### Purpose:

Classify fruits based on pictures. Can automatically help identify fruits in the wild. Can lead to application in computer vision applictaions in refrigerators.

### Method:

Train images of fruits from 81 different species with 160 labeled pictures per class using Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch.

### Dataset:

Data came from [fruits-360](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) dataset in kaggle. 

#### All process and methods can be found in the [Final Notebook](https://github.com/Sowmya-Iyer/Fruit-image-classifier/Fruit%20Classifier.ipynb)

### Final Model:
